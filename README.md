# :bug: Bug Out

A desktop Breakout arcade game with a subtle twist.
This time the paddle is a developer, the ball is a "hack" and the bricks are bugs in dire need of fixing.
This was created using the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) game engine.
You can find the link to the game right [here](https://bug-out.netlify.app/).

Go get 'em and good luck!
